# Monty Hall Simulator

Runs 1000 iterations with 3 boxes and prints the result to the console

## Usage
```bash 
./mvwn clean install
java -jar target/codetest-1.0.0.jar
```

### Prerequisites
Java 15 installed

#### TODOS:
- Send in the number of boxes and number of iterations as arguments
- Global error handler (Maybe a try/catch is enough)
